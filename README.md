# Multiplayer game using Photon Fusion 2
https://unijacob.itch.io/week-9

## Changes In the Original Game
1. Added shields: Every few seconds a yellow orb will spawn, when a player picks it up they will get a temporary bullet-proof shield.
2. Added cylindrical barricades that pop up from the ground at certain intervals, they provide cover and may be used by the players to outmanoeuvre their enemies.
3. When any player reaches 0 HP the match ends.

### Side Note
Game is pretty laggy on Itch (and in Shared mode in general), don't think there was anything I could've done about that given the assignment instructions and Fusion's nature.
